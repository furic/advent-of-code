Reversed Engineering
The input was a set of 18 instructions for each digit of the model number. 
The instruction sets could be split into two types. 
The first type always contained div z 1 and add x n (n>=10), this set would cause z to become bigger. 
The second type always contained div z 26 and add x n (n â‰¤ 0), this set would cause z to get smaller 
if the addition action would result in a number between 1 and 9. 
Inputs to the second type of instruction set could therefore be filtered out based on this knowledge.
